# BMP Surface Fetcher

This is a simple, two file library for Emscripten + SDL2, which allows you to fetch a BMP file directly to a SDL_Surface object.

## Usage

Look into the [example.c] file for an usage example.

To include the library in your project, add the .c and .h files.

You can also get those files with [clib] package manager

[clib]: https://github.com/clibs/clib

TL;DR:
1. Initialize a fetcher
2. call bmpsf_fetch with a desired filename
3. When polling SDL Events, look out for an event with your freshly-fetched SDL_Surface
